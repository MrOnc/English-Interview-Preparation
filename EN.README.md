This code contains an interface application called "Question App". The app randomly retrieves a question for the user and allows them to take notes on that question. It uses a data structure containing a list of questions and a JSON file for storing the user's notes for each question.

When the app is launched, a window opens with the question list on the left side and an interface on the right side displaying the text and keywords of the selected question. The user can select a question from the list and enter their notes for that question in the text box on the right side. When they click the "Save Note" button, the notes are saved to the JSON file, and a notification informs the user that the note has been successfully saved.

Additionally, clicking the "Get Question" button randomly selects a question and displays its text and any existing notes. This allows the user to take and manage notes for different questions.
